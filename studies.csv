In preparing this manuscript, we made a conscious effort to address citation bias. Following the approach outlined in Dworkin et al., 2020, we used open source code to assess the gender and racial balance of our citations based on the first names of the first and last authors (Zhou et al., 2022). Excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper, our references contain: 8.82% woman (first author)/woman (last author), 7.13% man/woman, 15.69% woman/man, and 68.36% man/man; and 9.75% author of color /author of color, 17.36% white author/author of color, 24.48% author of color/white author, and 48.41% white author/white author. Due to the historical nature of our inquiry, we also analyzed the gender balance of our citations published after the year 2000, and this subset of references contain: 16.07% woman/woman, 10.71% man/woman, 17.86% woman/man, and 55.36% man/man.",2050-084X
